    <h1>What Are Some Ways To Improve America's College Admission Process? </h1>

    <h2>1. Mandate A Record Of Test Prep Attendance</h2>

    <p>
      Universities can require test prep centers to submit the roster of students who attended tutoring. This is not intended to hurt students who received assistance. This is instead intended to give extra context for students who did not receive assistance but still scored decently on the SAT or ACT. 
    </p>

    <h2>2. Standardized Curricula And Grading</h2>

    <p>
      While standardizing academics across different schools may be difficult, it is certainly possible to standardize academics within the same school. The grading style and course rigor should remain consistent across teachers teaching the same course. This minimizes the impact of the type of teacher on student academics.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Middle School Extracurricular Culture</h2>

    <p>
      In high school, extracurricular culture is generally vibrant. Students are encouraged to stay after school to engage in clubs, sports, and other activities of interest. However, in middle school, this culture is not as pronounced. All middle schools should encourage students to pursue extracurricular activities by allotting spaces for recreation after school, establishing student clubs, or alerting students of opportunities elsewhere in their community. This allows for students to explore different interests before high school where they can devote themselves to a specific passion. Since funding plays a big role in the feasibility of having a strong extracurricular culture, universities should also mandate a report or profile of the student's middle school.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Virtual Campus Tours</h2>

    <p>
      Thankfully, many colleges are implementing virtual campus tours that can be accessed on the college websites. This allows for tours to be more accessible to interested students who live far away from the university. Attending an in-person tour should not give a student any advantage in order to retain fairness.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Remove "Underrepresented" From Minority</h2>
    <img src="assets/diversity.png" alt="Diverse crowd of people">
    <p>
      Universities should not narrow their consideration from minority races in general to "underrepresented minorities." The classification of underrepresented is very unclear and can often differ depending on the setting. Underrepresentation can be in terms of population, success, etc. The level of underrepresentation can also vary per individual. Race is not the only factor for determining how privileged a student is. Other factors include household income, access to opportunities, parent education level, middle school education, etc. Hence, instead of deciphering what "underrepresented" truly entails, universities should broaden their focus to minorities in general.
