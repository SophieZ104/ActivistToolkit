    <h1>What Are Some Problems With the American College Admission Process? </h1>

    <h2>1. Standardized Testing and Wealth</h2>

    <p>
      Although some universities have became test-optional in the wake of COVID-19, many top universities are returning to test-required. Therefore, standardized tests like the SAT or ACT are still used as metrics for determining an applicant's academic aptitude. As a result, many parents send their children to test prep centers or hire private tutors to ensure that their children can achieve high scores. However, this is linked to socioeconomic inequality since households with more income are more likely to spend money on test prep and tutoring services. This results in a disadvantage for students who come from low-income households.

    <h2>2. Grade Disparity</h2>

    <p>
      Although the consideration of student transcript grades may seem objective, there are actually many inconsistences that degrade the objectivity behind student grades. For example, some high schools only use unweighted GPA while other schools use weighted GPA. The course rigor/difficulty of the same courses can vary drastically across different high schools. This disparity can also be observed within the same school. Different teachers can have vastly different grading styles/course difficulties. Hence, even the teacher a student has can significantly impact the student's grades.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Middle School Disparity</h2>

    <p>
      A student's middle school life can impact their high school life which influences their chance of admission to a certain school. For example, some middle schools, often found in high-income neighborhoods, offer a variety of extracurriculars. This allows students to experiment with and explore different passions. This allows students to figure out what they are interested in before entering high school. Once students enter high school, they are able to identify and devote themselves to activities relating to their specific passion(s). On the other hand, high school students who did not graduate from such privileged middle schools use their time in high school to figure out their passions. As a result, the students' activities lists give off the impression that the students are not actively pursuing something they are passionate about. Passion and the relentless pursuit of passion are emphasized by many top colleges in the United States. Furthermore, middle schools that offer better education produce middle school graduates who are more likely to excel academically in high school.

    <h2>4. Demonstrated Interest Inequity</h2>

    <p>
      Although most top U.S. colleges do not consider demonstrated interest, many other colleges consider it. Demonstrated interest takes the form of students attending campus tours, clicking on email links, connecting with admissions officers, etc. However, for students who live far from a college's campus, they have to book flights to travel to the campus for a college tour. This implies that wealth is a factor in a student's ability to fully demonstrate interest in a college. Again, this puts low-income students at a disadvantage.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Asians and Underrepresentation</h2>
    <img src="minority.png" alt="A cartoon image of a crowd of people of diverse races">
    <p>
      Almost all American universities ask students if they identify as an underrepresented minority. This category often includes Black, Hispanic, Latino/Latinx, Native American, Alaskan Native, etc. However, the categorization of Asian students is a lot more vague. Asians are considered a minority in the United States due to being a minority in the American population. Yet, for some institutions, Asians are not considered an underrepresented minority due to sufficient Asian representation in top colleges or jobs. However, this overlooks the fact that many Asian students come from low-income households with parents who don't speak English. Hence, Asian high school students are actually at a disadvantage compared to other minorities simply because they are not considered underrepresented.
