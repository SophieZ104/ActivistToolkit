      Hi guys! If you are a high school student, you may have already sensed the upcoming dread of college applications aka the nightmare of your high school career. It is almost as if you had to start preparing for college applications when you just landed in high school. The pressure is real for high school students all around the globe! However, in the United States, our unique, but convoluted college admission process serves as an additional layer of stress. Unlike other countries that only consider students' transcript grades and exam scores, colleges in America consider a plethora of factors in their "holistic review of applications." To get a better sense of the various factors that come into play when applying for college, take this brief quiz below! 
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS QUIZ IS NOT AN ACCURATE NOR OFFICIAL REFLECTION OF YOUR CHANCES FOR ADMISSION INTO A TOP UNIVERSITY. THIS QUIZ IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!
